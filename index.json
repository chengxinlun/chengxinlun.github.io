The long-ranged and often frustrated electron-mediated spin interactions in these materials give rise to intriguing localized spin structures such as skyrmions. Yet, simulations of magnetization dynamics for such itinerant magnets are computationally difficult due to the need for repeated solutions to the electronic structure problems. We present a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to accurately and efficiently predict the electron-induced magnetic torques acting on local spins. Importantly, as the convolutional operations with a fixed kernel (receptive field) size naturally take advantage of the locality principle for many-electron systems, CNNs offer a scalable machine learning approach to spin dynamics. We apply our approach to enable large-scale dynamical simulations of skyrmion phases in itinerant spin systems. By incorporating the CNN model into Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert dynamics, our simulations successfully reproduce the relaxation process of the skyrmion phase and stabilize a skyrmion lattice in larger systems. The CNN model also allows us to compute the effective receptive fields, thus providing a systematic and unbiased method for determining the locality of the original electron models.","tags":["Machine Learning","Artificial Intelligence","Spin Dynamics"],"title":"Convolutional neural networks for large-scale dynamical modeling of itinerant magnets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bozsik, Spencer","Cheng, Xinlun","Kuncham, Malvika ","Mitchell, Evan"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1650978000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1650978000,"objectID":"01c13aac25d29ed8fa38c4f9bc2b1d6c","permalink":"https://chengxinlun.github.io/talk/apr2022_sieds/","publishdate":"2021-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/apr2022_sieds/","section":"talk","summary":"Charlottesville is an independent city in central Virginia currently undergoing a rezoning process in an attempt to address the local impact of the housing affordability crisis. Restrictive, low-density zoning and gentrification have led to the displacement of many income-constrained Charlottesville residents. Local journalists are the primary information sources for residents about the crisis, but public data quantifying crisis impacts are often inaccessible to the public and to local media due to the technical experience required for data access and analysis. As a result, residents seeking to understand the landscape of housing in Charlottesville are not taking full advantage of the information contained within public datasets as rezoning discussions take place. The focus of this project is to create a public dashboard in cooperation with local journalists to display and contextualize Charlottesville housing affordability data. Figures included in the dashboard make use of publicly available data from the Census, Bureau of Labor Statistics, ALICE (Asset Limited, Income Constrained, Employed) Project, and Charlottesville Open Data Portal, which have been cleaned, joined, and aggregated for plotting. The dashboard displays maps that geographically visualize home rental and purchase prices and identify the locations of resources such as public transportation and grocery stores,  animated bar charts representing historical demographic information from the Census, and line graphs of historical median home prices. Neighborhood development is a central focus. We hope this platform for contextualizing and communicating data through data journalism will support advocacy for affordable housing initiatives and encourage more data scientists to carry out similar projects highlighting trends in their own communities.","tags":["Conference Talk","IEEE","SIEDS"],"title":"Democratizing Housing Affordability Data: Open Data and Data Journalism in Charlottesville, VA","type":"talk"},{"authors":["**Cheng, Xinlun**","Choi, Yumi","Olsen, Knut","Nidever, David L.","Majewski, Steven R.","Monachesi, Antonela","Besla, Gurtina","Muñoz Gonzalez, Cesar","Anguiano, Borja","Almeida, Andres","Muñoz, Ricardo R.","Lane, Richard R.","Nitschelm, Christian"],"categories":[],"content":"Abstract We report the first 3-D kinematical measurements of 88 stars in the direction of several recently discovered substructures in the southern periphery of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) using a combination of Gaia proper motions and radial velocities from the APOGEE-2 survey.

We find that $81.9 \\pm 3.1$% of the objects in the selected Gaia data-set are thin-disk stars, $16.6 \\pm 3.2$% are thick-disk stars, and $1.5 \\pm 0.1$% belong to the Milky Way stellar halo. We also find the local thick-to-thin-disk density normalization to be $\\rho_{T}(R_{\\odot})/\\rho_{t}(R_{\\odot}) = 2.1 \\pm 0.2$%, a result consistent with, but determined in a completely different way than, typical starcount/density analyses. Using the same methodology, the local halo-to-disk density normalization is found to be $\\rho_{H}(R_{\\odot})/(\\rho_{T}(R_{\\odot}) + \\rho_{t}(R_{\\odot})) = 1.2 \\pm 0.6$%, a value that may be inflated due to chemical overlap of halo and metal-weak thick disk stars.\n","date":1593561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1593561600,"objectID":"5b69ce55a93bbcf311aca8692dbd40cc","permalink":"https://chengxinlun.github.io/publication/2020aj....160...43a/","publishdate":"2020-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020aj....160...43a/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract The stellar velocity distribution function (DF) in the solar vicinity is re-examined using data from the SDSS APOGEE survey\u0026rsquo;s DR16 and Gaia DR2.

Although the ripple of negative $V_R$ at $\\sim9$ kpc extends to about 40$^\\circ$ in the azimuth angle, it does not align with either the Local or the Perseus spiral arm. Moreover, the farther ripple beyond 13,kpc does not match the Outer spiral arm either. This indicates that the non-axisymmetric kinematic features are not induced by perturbations of known spiral structures. The central rotating bar can not lead to such patterns in the outer disk either. External perturbation of a dwarf galaxy or a dark matter sub-halo can induce such patterns but requires more evidence from both observations and simulations. The $V_\\phi$ map in the $Z$\u0026ndash;$V_Z$ plane of the OB stars is also investigated. Despite asymmetry to some degree, no spiral pattern is found. This is reasonable since most of the OB stars have ages much younger than 100 Myrs, which is smaller than one orbital period around the Galactic center.\n","date":1548979200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548979200,"objectID":"2e752aa91b3989e1f7142c2ead169275","permalink":"https://chengxinlun.github.io/publication/2019apj...872l...1c/","publishdate":"2019-02-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019apj...872l...1c/","section":"publication","summary":"Abstract With about 12,000 OB type stars selected from the LAMOST and Gaia survey, we study their 3 dimensional velocity distribution over the range of galactocentric radius from 6 to 15 kpc in the Galactic disk plane.
