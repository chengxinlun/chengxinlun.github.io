      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Previous analyses of large databases of Milky Way stars have revealed the stellar disk of our Galaxy to be warped and that this imparts a strong signature on the kinematics of stars beyond the solar neighborhood. However, due to the limitation of accurate distance estimates, many attempts to explore the extent of these Galactic features have generally been restricted to a volume near the Sun. By combining Gaia DR2 astrometric solution, StarHorse distance and stellar abundances from the APOGEE survey, we present the most detailed and radially expansive study yet of the vertical and radial motions of stars in the Galactic disk. We map stellar velocity with respect to their Galactocentric radius, angular momentum, and azimuthal angle and assess their relation to the warp. A decrease in vertical velocity is discovered at Galactocentric radius $R=13$ kpc and angular momentum $L_z=2800$ kpc km s$^{-1}$. Smaller ripples in vertical and radial velocity are also discovered superposed on the main trend. We also discovered that trends in the vertical velocity with azimuthal angle are not symmetric about the peak, suggesting the warp to be lopsided. To explain the global trend in vertical velocity, we built a simple analytical model of the Galactic warp. Our best fit yields a starting radius of $8.87^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ kpc and precession rate of $13.57^{+0.20}_{-0.18}$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$. These parameters remain consistent across stellar age groups, a result that supports the notion that the warp is the result of an external, gravitationally induced phenomenon.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Ripple Patterns in In-plane Velocities of OB Stars from LAMOST and Gaia</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;abstract&#34;&gt;Abstract&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With about 12,000 OB type stars selected from the LAMOST and &lt;em&gt;Gaia&lt;/em&gt; survey, we study their 3 dimensional velocity distribution over the range of galactocentric radius from 6 to 15 kpc in the Galactic disk plane. A clear ripple pattern in the radial velocity ($V_R$) map is shown. The median $V_R$ reaches $-8$ km s$^{-1}$ at $R\sim9$ kpc, then increases to $\sim0$ km s$^{-1}$ at $R\sim12$ kpc, and later declines to below $-10$ km s$^{-1}$ beyond $R\sim13$,kpc. The median azimuthal velocity ($V_\phi$) map shows a similar pattern but has roughly $1/4$ phase difference with the radial velocity. Although the ripple of negative $V_R$ at $\sim9$ kpc extends to about 40$^\circ$ in the azimuth angle, it does not align with either the Local or the Perseus spiral arm. Moreover, the farther ripple beyond 13,kpc does not match the Outer spiral arm either. This indicates that the non-axisymmetric kinematic features are not induced by perturbations of known spiral structures. The central rotating bar can not lead to such patterns in the outer disk either. External perturbation of a dwarf galaxy or a dark matter sub-halo can induce such patterns but requires more evidence from both observations and simulations. The $V_\phi$ map in the $Z$&amp;ndash;$V_Z$ plane of the OB stars is also investigated. Despite asymmetry to some degree, no spiral pattern is found. This is reasonable since most of the OB stars have ages much younger than 100 Myrs, which is smaller than one orbital period around the Galactic center.&lt;/p&gt;
